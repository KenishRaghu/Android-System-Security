# Malware Analysis and Behavior Inspection

## Approach

Behavior inspection focuses on what an Android application does at runtime and which system interfaces it uses, rather than only static code patterns. This complements signature-based detection.

## System Interactions to Inspect

1. **Permissions and API usage** — Map declared and requested permissions to actual calls (e.g., `READ_SMS`, `RECORD_AUDIO`, `ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION`) and identify overprivilege or hidden functionality.
2. **Network and connectivity** — Outbound connections (IPs, domains, ports), use of WebView or custom protocols, and any C2-like or data-exfiltration behavior.
3. **File and storage access** — Reads/writes outside app sandbox (where allowed), access to shared storage or other apps’ content providers, and creation of executable or script files.
4. **Component exposure** — Exported activities, services, or receivers that accept external input; deep links or intent filters that could be triggered by malicious callers.
5. **Sensitive APIs** — Access to accounts, telephony, clipboard, accessibility services, or device admin; use of reflection or native code to bypass restrictions.

## Identifying Suspicious Behaviors

- **Unnecessary permissions** — Requesting SMS, contacts, or location without a clear user-facing need.
- **Obfuscation and packing** — Heavy obfuscation, encrypted payloads, or loading code from native libraries or network.
- **Persistence and privilege** — Device-admin enrollment, auto-start receivers, or abuse of accessibility services.
- **Data exfiltration** — Sending PII, credentials, or device identifiers to remote servers without consent or encryption.

Documenting these for each sample (e.g., in a short table or checklist) supports the findings and defensive recommendations in the next section.
